<h1 id="a-new-blog">A New Blog</h1>
<p>This post is the first in a hopefully successful private blog. I hope to write posts as I learn new skills in data and design. I'd like to use this blog to showcase simple and pleasing design and new techniques and projects in my professional and hobbyist data science career.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I am a 26 year old data analyst working in the healthcare data industry with an interest in statistics, data science, and exploration. As an indication of how uninspiring my life is I also enjoy data science as a hobby. I believe as well that data analysis informs many of my other hobbies, as long as I am disciplined enough to collect the data. Perhaps most of my posts will start from an exploration of soccer, cooking, biking and hiking, mapping, or psychology.</p>
<p>At the time of writing I live in downtown Baltimore, just a few blocks from the Inner Harbor. This city is certainly troubled but also beautiful and unique, and full of things to explore. It is improving every year and I hope to feature it often in my blog.</p>
<p><IMG class="displayed" src="Images/Baltimore.jpg" alt="Baltimore's Inner Harbor" style="float: middle;margin: auto" align="middle"></p>
